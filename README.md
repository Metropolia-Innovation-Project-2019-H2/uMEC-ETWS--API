# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

## What is this project?

This is a student project that was made in collaboration with Nokia.
The goal was to create a localhost server with OpenAPI Generator, that utilizes a usb camera to take pictures remotely and uploads the images to the localhost server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+
Raspberry Pi
Laptop 
Usb Camera


## Usage
To run the server, execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:591/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:591/openapi.json
```
## Note: The default port for the previous steps is 8080 but the port was occupied so 591 was used

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 openapi_server
```

## The Following Instructions are for Recreating the Entire Project
```
OpenAPI Specification is an API description format, formerly known as Swagger Specification
npm is a software registry that contains the required code package to install OpenAPI. 
```

#### First create a folder OpenApi, then go to that folder
```
mkdir /home/pi/OpenApi
cd OpenApi
apt-get install npm
```
#### Then install OpenApi Generator
```
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
```
#### Create parts.yaml with command: 
```
touch parts.yaml. 
```
#### Then paste the following code into that file.
```

  	description: Retrieve the current camera image.
 	# parameters:

            	type: string
            	format: binary
            	description: The current camera image.
```
#### Then run the following command into command line interface (CLI):
```
openapi-generator generate -i parts.yaml -g python-flask -o /Openapi/local
```
#### This will provide a readme file in the current folder, the “ls” command will confirm. Follow its instructions to get the localhost web server running.
<br>
#### There should be several files and folders within the openapi folder. Open the “openapi_server” folder and then “controllers” . Once inside create file named default_controller.py

#### Type
```
touch default_controller.py
```
#### Paste the following code when inside the file:
```
import connexion
import six
import requests
from flask import send_file
from openapi_server import util
from cv2 import *
def camera_get():
	cam = VideoCapture(0)   # 0 -> index of camera
	s, img = cam.read() #read cam and take picture as img
	cam.release()
	imwrite("image.jpg",img) #save img file as jpg
	f = open("image.jpg", "rb")  # open in binary mode
	"""
	GET image

	Retrieve the current camera image. # noqa: E501


	:rtype: file
	"""
	return send_file(f, mimetype='image/jpeg')
```
